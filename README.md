## Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

As a traveler I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities; so that I can plan a trip accordingly

## Acceptance Criteria

## GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs:
- I search for a city
- I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
- I view current weather conditions for that city
- I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
- I view the UV index
- I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
- I view future weather conditions for that city
- I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
- I can have multiple cities in my search history
- I click on a city in the search history
